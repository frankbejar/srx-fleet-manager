# SRX Fleet Manager

**Enterprise-grade Juniper SRX firewall fleet management platform**

A modern, locally-hosted network operations toolkit to centrally manage, monitor, and maintain 50+ Juniper SRX firewalls across multiple sites.

---

## üéØ Purpose

Reduce manual effort, speed up routine maintenance, standardize change execution, and improve safety and auditability for firewall operations.

### Key Features

- **Fleet Monitoring** - Real-time health checks, tunnel status, version tracking
- **Config Management** - Automated backups with Git versioning and diffs
- **Safe Operations** - Commit-confirmed changes with auto-rollback
- **Change Validation** - JSNAPy pre/post checks for all changes
- **Audit Trail** - Complete job history and artifact tracking
- **Status Reports** - Generate and upload change documentation to SharePoint

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) - Modern, responsive UI with real-time updates
- **Backend**: FastAPI - High-performance Python API
- **Workers**: Celery + Redis - Async job queue for background operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - Device inventory, jobs, audit trail
- **Automation**: Nornir + PyEZ + JSNAPy - Juniper-native automation
- **Versioning**: Git - Automatic config version control
- **Integration**: Microsoft Graph API - SharePoint status reports

### Local-First Design

Everything runs on your local machine or server:
- ‚úÖ No Azure hosting required
- ‚úÖ No cloud storage dependencies
- ‚úÖ SharePoint only for report uploads
- ‚úÖ Complete offline capability

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Network access to SRX devices (SSH/NETCONF)
- Microsoft 365 tenant (for SharePoint integration - optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frankbejar/srx-fleet-manager.git
   cd srx-fleet-manager
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

3. **Start the platform:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the UI:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3001
   ```

5. **Import your devices:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/import_devices.py --csv /path/to/inventory.csv
   ```

## üìä Current Status

**Version**: 1.0.0-alpha
**Devices Supported**: 77 Juniper SRX firewalls
**Regions**: 10 (AZ, NM, TX, NV, CO, IL, NY)
**Status**: Fully operational with modern dashboard UI, automated monitoring, and Git-versioned backups

### Implemented Features

‚úÖ **Dashboard** - Modern redesigned UI with alert banner, horizontal stats, side-by-side charts
‚úÖ **Device Management** - Full CRUD operations, filtering by status/region/version
‚úÖ **Health Monitoring** - UptimeRobot integration for external monitoring (replaces local checks)
‚úÖ **Config Backups** - Automated nightly backups with Git versioning
‚úÖ **Job Queue** - Celery-based async job processing with real-time status
‚úÖ **API** - FastAPI with CORS support for localhost:3000 and localhost:3001
‚úÖ **Database** - PostgreSQL with device inventory and job history
